First clone or download `DevConnector-BackEnd` repository in your local computer.
Use `npm i` command to generate `node_modules` in `DevConnector-BackEnd` folder.
Create new client in `DevConnector-BackEnd` using command `ng new client`.
Use `npm i` command to generate `node_modules` in `DevConnector-BackEnd\client` folder.
Replace the `src` folder in generated client folder with the `src` folder of my `DevConnector-FrontEnd` repository.
Copy `proxy.conf.json` file from `DevConnector-FrontEnd` repository to the generated client folder in `DevConnector-BackEnd` folder.
Run first backend through command `npm run server` in `DevConnector-BackEnd` folder in terminal.
Then run client through command `npm start` in `DevConnector-BackEnd\client` folder in another terminal.

Since application is in development mode, you must have `nodejs`, `mongodb` and `mongodbcompass`.
In `keys.js` of `config` folder, you must provide mongodb URI in "mongoURI" parameter such as "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/devconnector".
You will see all the database related details in `mongodbcompass`.
